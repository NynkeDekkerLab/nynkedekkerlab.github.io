Usage
=====

Starting the GUI
----------------

To start up the GUI, first activate the virtual environment :code:`venv`.
Then use the (PyCharm) terminal to run the command ::

    python -m ctrappy.run

The GUI should appear. If this is not the case, try to look
for the address of the GUI in the terminal window and copy
and paste that address into the address bar of a web browser.
It should look something like :code:`http://localhost:8501`.

If you get a streamlit error, you can also try from the root directory: ::

    streamlit run ctrappy/gui.py

Use the navigation button at the top left to select
the functionality you want to use.

GUI tabs
--------

An overview of the functionality of each GUI tab can be
found in :code:`README_GUI_TABS.md`.

Set GUI default values
----------------------

To set default values for the GUI, copy the file
:code:`ymls/gui_defaults/gui_defaults.yml`, and rename it to
:code:`ymls/gui_defaults/gui_custom.yml`. Now you can change the values
in the file; these values will be the default values when running the GUI.
