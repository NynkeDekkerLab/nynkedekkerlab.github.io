CTrapPy documentation
=====================

CTrapPy provides C-Trap (and Q-trap) scan processing for Python,
using a streamlit GUI. This interface
is used to process and filter experiments consisting of multiple C-trap
output files, and to generate and customize figures from the
resulting data. It can also be used in the lab, to quickly see the
contents of raw microscope output.

In the API tab you can find the full documentation of every single class and function
in the ctrappy code.
