* **corrected_intensity**: float, intensity corrected for crosstalk
* **dna_end_pixel**: float, ending pixel coordinate of DNA (right offset)
* **dna_length_kbp**: float, dna length in kbp
* **dna_start_pixel**: float, starting pixel coordinate of DNA (left offset)
* **file_name**: str, name of file on file system
* **frame**: integer frame number
* **frame_subindex**: integer, index for each spot in a scan in a frame (used for making LAP matrices)
* **intensity**: integer, sum of pixel values in detected spot
* **laser_colors**: str; all laser colors that were used during the experiment
* **lifetime**: integer, lifetime of the track in frames
* **n_frames**: integer, number of frames of scan
* **n_scans**: integer, number of scans in experiment
* **scan_id**: integer, identifier for scan
* **spot_id**: integer, unique index for each spot (not used)
* **step_count**: integer, number of steps in track (from step fitting the bleaching trace)
* **time_s**: float, time in seconds
* **trace_id**: integer, identifier for colocalized tracks of different colors
* **track_id**: integer, a spot of a single color, tracked over time (unique after selecting a **scan_id** and **frame**)
* **x_kbp**: float, distance to left bead edge in kbp
* **x_micron**: float, distance to left bead edge in micron
* **x_pixel**: float, x-location of spot in pixels in absolute coordinates
* **y_pixel**: float, y-location of spot in pixels in absolute coordinates

Table indices and class hierarchy
---------------------------------

The :code:`scans.csv` table has several index (:code:`*_id`) columns. The most useful way
to think about these is as follows.

A *track* is a single-color spot, tracked over multiple frames in a *scan*.
Hence, a track contains multiple spot locations; at most one spot location
for each frame, although some frames might be skipped.
By picking a :code:`scan_id`, :code:`track_id` in the table
you can find each separate track that is present in the dataset. The :code:`trace_id`
index groups colocalized tracks together.

This data hierarchy is mirrored in the way the code is organized into classes.
An *Experiment* can contain multiple *Scans* (one for each image taken);
a *Scan* can contain multiple *Traces*; a *Trace* can contain multiple
(colocalized) *Tracks*. A *Track* is a single-color spot, tracked over
multiple frames.

Different physical quantities belong to different levels in this class hierarchy.
Stoichiometry, for example, is a :code:`Trace` attribute, but fluorophore lifetime
is a :code:`Track` attribute.
